## 2025-03-24 - Proxy Request Header Stripping
**Vulnerability:** The proxy implementation in `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts` stripped all client headers (including `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and `Content-Type`) by spreading `c.req.raw.headers` (`{ ...c.req.raw.headers }`) into a plain JavaScript object.
**Learning:** `Headers` objects in the Fetch API do not store their data as enumerable properties. Spreading them results in an empty object `{}`. When proxying requests, this leads to silent authentication bypasses and dropped context for the upstream server.
**Prevention:** Always instantiate a new `Headers` object from the existing headers (e.g., `new Headers(c.req.raw.headers)`) or use `Object.fromEntries(c.req.raw.headers.entries())` when manipulating or forwarding fetch requests.

## 2025-05-15 - Command Injection in Browser Opening
**Vulnerability:** Command injection in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/github.ts` due to use of `child_process.exec` with template literals for URLs.
**Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands if the URL contains shell metacharacters like `&`, `;`, or `|`.
**Fix:** Replaced `exec` with `spawn`, passing arguments as an array to avoid shell interpretation.
**Verification:** Verified via platform-specific simulation script.
## 2024-03-27 - Command injection in wslPath
**Vulnerability:** Shell command injection via unsanitized user input in `wsl -e sh -lc "wslpath..."`.
**Learning:** Even if quotes are escaped, interpolating untrusted paths into a shell command string (`sh -c <string>`) leaves the command vulnerable to shell metacharacters like backticks or `$()`.
**Prevention:** Pass variables as discrete arguments to `sh` and refer to them inside the shell string with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
