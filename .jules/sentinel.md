## 2025-05-15 - Command Injection in Browser Opening
**Vulnerability:** Command injection in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/github.ts` due to use of `child_process.exec` with template literals for URLs.
**Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands if the URL contains shell metacharacters like `&`, `;`, or `|`.
**Fix:** Replaced `exec` with `spawn`, passing arguments as an array to avoid shell interpretation.
**Verification:** Verified via platform-specific simulation script.
## 2024-03-27 - Command injection in wslPath
**Vulnerability:** Shell command injection via unsanitized user input in `wsl -e sh -lc "wslpath..."`.
**Learning:** Even if quotes are escaped, interpolating untrusted paths into a shell command string (`sh -c <string>`) leaves the command vulnerable to shell metacharacters like backticks or `$()`.
**Prevention:** Pass variables as discrete arguments to `sh` and refer to them inside the shell string with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
## 2026-03-28 - Command Injection Prevention in Node.js Shell Spawns
**Vulnerability:** Found a command injection vulnerability where a string array `args` was directly concatenated into a shell command for execution (e.g., `"sh -c \"sidecar\" " + args`) in `packages/desktop-electron/src/main/cli.ts`.
**Learning:** Using `spawn` or `execFile` with an options array directly is preferred over passing an entire string to `sh -c`. If executing via a shell wrapper like `sh -c` is necessary, it is critical to correctly escape all user-influenced string arguments before interpolating them into the final shell command to prevent injection.
**Prevention:** Use a proven library like `shell-quote` to escape array elements before concatenating them into shell script strings, or prefer passing discrete arguments directly to the spawn function instead of interpolating into a shell wrapper.
## 2025-03-24 - Prevent Unsafe URL Schemes in shell.openExternal
**Vulnerability:** The Electron `ipcMain` handler for `open-link` directly passed unsanitized user-provided URLs to `shell.openExternal()`. This allows an attacker to open arbitrary local files or execute commands using schemes like `file://` or `smb://`.
**Learning:** In Electron, `shell.openExternal` is dangerous when used with untrusted input because it hands off the URL to the OS's default handler, which can execute local programs or scripts if a malicious protocol is provided.
**Prevention:** Always validate and allowlist URL protocols (e.g., `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) using the `URL` constructor before passing them to `shell.openExternal()`.

## 2025-05-18 - Path Traversal & Command Injection in ExecFile Target
**Vulnerability:** The `open-path` IPC handler in Electron passed unsanitized strings from the renderer directly as the target command for `execFile` (or `-a` for mac). This allows opening unintended executables or potential path traversal by an attacker in the renderer.
**Learning:** The application name must be strictly validated before resolving its path and passing it to execution contexts. Checking for path separators ensures the user isn't trying to supply an arbitrary path instead of an application name.
**Prevention:** Ensure the app name string does not contain path separators (`/[/\\]/`), verify its existence, and resolve it securely before execution.
