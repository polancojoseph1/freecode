## 2025-03-24 - Proxy Request Header Stripping
**Vulnerability:** The proxy implementation in `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts` stripped all client headers (including `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and `Content-Type`) by spreading `c.req.raw.headers` (`{ ...c.req.raw.headers }`) into a plain JavaScript object.
**Learning:** `Headers` objects in the Fetch API do not store their data as enumerable properties. Spreading them results in an empty object `{}`. When proxying requests, this leads to silent authentication bypasses and dropped context for the upstream server.
**Prevention:** Always instantiate a new `Headers` object from the existing headers (e.g., `new Headers(c.req.raw.headers)`) or use `Object.fromEntries(c.req.raw.headers.entries())` when manipulating or forwarding fetch requests.

## 2025-05-15 - Command Injection in Browser Opening
**Vulnerability:** Command injection in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/github.ts` due to use of `child_process.exec` with template literals for URLs.
**Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands if the URL contains shell metacharacters like `&`, `;`, or `|`.
**Fix:** Replaced `exec` with `spawn`, passing arguments as an array to avoid shell interpretation.
**Verification:** Verified via platform-specific simulation script.
## 2024-03-27 - Command injection in wslPath
**Vulnerability:** Shell command injection via unsanitized user input in `wsl -e sh -lc "wslpath..."`.
**Learning:** Even if quotes are escaped, interpolating untrusted paths into a shell command string (`sh -c <string>`) leaves the command vulnerable to shell metacharacters like backticks or `$()`.
**Prevention:** Pass variables as discrete arguments to `sh` and refer to them inside the shell string with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
## 2026-03-28 - Command Injection Prevention in Node.js Shell Spawns
**Vulnerability:** Found a command injection vulnerability where a string array `args` was directly concatenated into a shell command for execution (e.g., ``"sh -c \"sidecar\" " + args``) in `packages/desktop-electron/src/main/cli.ts`.
**Learning:** Using `spawn` or `execFile` with an options array directly is preferred over passing an entire string to `sh -c`. If executing via a shell wrapper like `sh -c` is necessary, it is critical to correctly escape all user-influenced string arguments before interpolating them into the final shell command to prevent injection.
**Prevention:** Use a proven library like `shell-quote` to escape array elements before concatenating them into shell script strings, or prefer passing discrete arguments directly to the spawn function instead of interpolating into a shell wrapper.
## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Prevent Unsafe URL Schemes in shell.openExternal
**Vulnerability:** The Electron `ipcMain` handler for `open-link` directly passed unsanitized user-provided URLs to `shell.openExternal()`. This allows an attacker to open arbitrary local files or execute commands using schemes like `file://` or `smb://`.
**Learning:** In Electron, `shell.openExternal` is dangerous when used with untrusted input because it hands off the URL to the OS's default handler, which can execute local programs or scripts if a malicious protocol is provided.
**Prevention:** Always validate and allowlist URL protocols (e.g., `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) using the `URL` constructor before passing them to `shell.openExternal()`.
## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Prevent Arbitrary Code Execution in Electron ipcMain open-path
**Vulnerability:** The `ipcMain.handle("open-path", ...)` handler in `packages/desktop-electron/src/main/ipc.ts` allowed the renderer to pass an arbitrary application name/path as the `app` parameter, which was passed directly to `execFile`. This constitutes a Critical Arbitrary Code Execution risk from the renderer process.
**Learning:** Never trust the renderer to determine which executables can run, even if the renderer code seems to resolve it correctly. The main process must act as a trust boundary.
**Prevention:** In Electron IPC handlers (`packages/desktop-electron`), never pass unsanitized executable names or paths from the renderer directly to `execFile` or `spawn`. Always validate the application against a strict allowlist of permitted applications before checking existence or resolving paths. To check existence and resolve paths, use the `await deps.checkAppExists` and `await deps.resolveAppPath` methods provided via the injected `deps` object rather than importing them as standalone functions, as these interface methods may return Promises. Validating existence alone is insufficient as attackers can exploit built-in executables.
